It's ready. I finished proofreading, I swapped out my markdown implementation, and I threw a fresh coat of paint on the site. The hardest step left is picking what domain I want to use.

I also need to choose between Digitalocean and Linode. I feel like I should give Linode a shot just because I haven't used it before.

The next features I plan to work on are pagination and full text search with Meilisearch. Tags will come at some point. So will some kind of self-hosted analytics.

I'm pumped to get this site live. Cool things are coming!
