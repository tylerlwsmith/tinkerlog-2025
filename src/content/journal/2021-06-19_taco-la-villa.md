My favorite food in the world might be tacos from the Bakersfield taco chain, Taco La Villa.

Since the pandemic ended, [I've sampled almost all of my favorite prepandemic foods](/journal/eating-takeout-again-post-pandemic). I've been disappointed by most of them.

I think that's the reason that I've been avoiding Taco La Villa. I think I thought I'd be as disappointed with the experience as I was with McDonalds and Carls Jr.

Tonight, I can confirm: Taco La Villa does not disappoint. Hot damn.
