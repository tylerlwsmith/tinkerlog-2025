I'm still burnt out on provisioning and configuration management, so I worked on my resume. About two years ago I did my resume in HTML because I found it easier to control the spacing using CSS than it would be to control using something like InDesign. Since then I've updated it pretty much every time I've learned a new skill. Yesterday I made it mobile responsive and today I lauched it [as a website](https://raspberrytyler.com) (if you're reading this in the future I may have moved this to a different domain). I also put it as a [public repo on GitHub](https://github.com/tylerlwsmith/resume), though since there's no server or compile step you can see the source by just inspecting the page. I'm trying to get more comfortable showing my work.

I also continued learning about computer networking today. That involves more that than I'd hope. Within a week I'll probably put that endeavor on pause for a while.
